# Periodic Wakeup Timer Example

This example demonstrates how to set up a periodic wakeup timer using the RIOT operating system.

## Overview

The application sets up a timer that periodically wakes up the system and performs a specific task. This is useful for applications that need to perform regular actions, such as sensor readings or data transmissions.

## Requirements

- RIOT OS
- A supported hardware platform

## Setup

1. Clone the RIOT repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git
    cd RIOT
    ```

2. Navigate to the example directory:
    ```sh
    cd examples/timer_periodic_wakeup
    ```

3. Build the application for your target hardware:
    ```sh
    make BOARD=<your-board>
    ```

4. Flash the application to your hardware:
    ```sh
    make flash
    ```

5. Connect to the board's serial console to observe the output:
    ```sh
    make term
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you should see periodic messages indicating that the timer has triggered and the system has woken up to perform its task.
